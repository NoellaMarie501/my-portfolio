## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details to practice your skills using this app

- **Built with React**  
  Utilizes functional components and React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management and lifecycle control.

- **API Data Fetching**  
  Fetches Pok√©mon data from the public [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co) using `fetch` and Axios for reliable HTTP requests.

- **Infinite Scroll Implementation**  
  Uses an intersection observer to detect when the user nears the bottom of the list and automatically loads more Pok√©mon in batches, improving performance by lazy loading data.

- **Debounced Search Input**  
  Implements a debounce function to reduce API calls while typing, sending search queries only after the user pauses typing for 300ms.

- **State Management**  
  Manages search input, loading states, and Pok√©mon data efficiently with React hooks.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Styled with CSS Flexbox and Grid for a layout that adapts smoothly across devices.
